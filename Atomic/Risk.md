Risk means the probability of an adverse circumstance or event that could negatively affect the project, product, or business.

Risks represent uncertainties that may cause problems or delays if they occur.

Understanding and managing risks is essential to increase the chances of project success.

There are three main types of risks to consider:

- **Project risks**  
  These are risks related to the management and execution of the project itself.  
  Examples include staff turnover, management change, hardware unavailability, requirements change, and specification delays.

- **Product risks**  
  These risks concern the quality and performance of the product being developed.  
  Examples include requirements change, specification delays, size underestimate, and software tool underperformance.

- **Business risks**  
  These risks affect the broader business environment or market.  
  Examples include technology change and product competition.

## Project Risks

Project risks are risks related to the management and execution of the project itself.

They affect how well the project is planned, organised, and controlled.

#### Examples

- **Staff turnover**  
  Experienced staff will leave the project before it is finished, causing loss of knowledge and delays.

- **Management change**  
  Changes in company management bring different priorities that may affect project direction or funding.

- **Hardware unavailability**  
  Essential hardware needed for the project will not be delivered on schedule, causing delays.

- **Requirements change**  
  A larger number of changes to the requirements than anticipated disrupt planning and development.

- **Specification delays**  
  Specifications and essential interfaces are not available on time, slowing progress.

Managing project risks involves careful planning, realistic scheduling, clear communication, and monitoring progress regularly.

## Product Risks

Product risks concern the quality, performance, and functionality of the product being developed.

They affect whether the product meets requirements and satisfies users.

#### Examples

- **Requirements change**  
  Frequent or late changes to requirements cause rework and uncertainty.

- **Specification delays**  
  Delays in receiving detailed specifications hinder development and testing.

- **Size underestimate**  
  The size or complexity of the system is underestimated, leading to insufficient resources or time.

- **Software tool underperformance**  
  Software tools that support the product do not perform as anticipated, reducing productivity or quality.

Reducing product risks requires thorough requirements analysis, careful design, testing, and user feedback.

## Business Risks

Business risks affect the broader business environment, market, or organisation.

They influence the viability and success of the project beyond technical or project concerns.

#### Examples

- **Technology change**  
  The underlying technology on which the system is built is superseded by new technology, making the product obsolete or requiring redesign.

- **Product competition**  
  A competitive product is marketed before the system is completed, reducing market share or demand.

Managing business risks involves market research, monitoring external factors, and aligning the project with business strategy.

## Risk Strategies and Planning

Managing risks effectively requires choosing appropriate strategies to handle each identified risk. Common risk strategies include:

- **Transfer**  
  Pass on responsibility for the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance, outsourcing).

- **Accept**  
  Take the chance and accept the risk without specific action, often when the risk impact is low.

- **Mitigate**  
  Take actions to minimize the consequences or likelihood of the risk.

- **Eliminate**  
  Remove the risk entirely by changing the project plan or approach.

---

## Risk Planning Categories

Risk planning involves developing approaches to deal with risks before they occur:

- **Avoidance strategies**  
  Ways to avoid risks altogether by changing plans or requirements.

- **Minimisation strategies**  
  Ways to reduce the possible damage or likelihood of risks.

- **Contingency plans**  
  Preparing for the worst-case scenarios with backup plans if risks materialise.

## Risk Monitoring

Risk monitoring is the continuous process of checking that assumptions about risks remain valid throughout the project lifecycle. It involves:

- Regularly reviewing risks at all project stages.

- Asking key questions such as:  
  - Is the risk becoming more or less probable?  
  - Have the effects of the risk changed?

- Watching for potential indicators of risk types:

| Risk Type      | Potential Indicators                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Estimation     | Failure to meet schedule; unresolved defects                                        |
| Organizational | Gossip; lack of senior management action                                            |
| People         | Poor morale; team conflicts; high turnover                                          |
| Requirements   | Many change requests; customer complaints                                           |
| Technology     | Late hardware/software delivery; frequent tech problems                             |
| Tools          | Reluctance to use tools; complaints about software or hardware                      |

## Risk Analysis

Risk analysis is the process of evaluating identified risks to understand their likelihood and potential impact on the project, product, or business.

It helps prioritise which risks need the most attention and guides planning of mitigation strategies.

Two key factors are assessed for each risk:

- **Probability** (1 to 5)  
  How likely the risk is to occur, where 1 means very unlikely and 5 means very likely.

- **Impact** (1 to 5)  
  How severe the consequences would be if the risk occurs, where 1 means minimal impact and 5 means critical impact.

By combining probability and impact, we can focus on risks that pose the greatest threat.

The table below shows a risk analysis example for a chat application project.

This analysis helps the team focus on high probability and high impact risks first.

It also supports communication with stakeholders by clearly showing risk priorities and planned responses.

## Impact Matrix

An impact matrix is a visual tool used in risk management to categorise and prioritise risks based on their probability and impact.

It is usually displayed as a grid where one axis represents the probability of a risk occurring and the other axis represents the impact if it does occur.

Each risk is placed in the matrix according to its assessed probability and impact scores.

The matrix helps quickly identify which risks are most critical and require immediate attention or mitigation.

Risks in the high probability and high impact area are the highest priority.

Risks with low probability and low impact are lower priority and may be monitored with less urgency.

Using an impact matrix supports clear communication among team members and stakeholders by providing a simple overview of risk severity.
