Risk means the probability of an adverse circumstance or event that could negatively affect the project, product, or business.

Risks represent uncertainties that may cause problems or delays if they occur.

Understanding and managing risks is essential to increase the chances of project success.

There are three main types of risks to consider:

- **[[Project Risks]]**  
  These are risks related to the management and execution of the project itself.  
  Examples include staff turnover, management change, hardware unavailability, requirements change, and specification delays.

- **[[Product Risks]]**  
  These risks concern the quality and performance of the product being developed.  
  Examples include requirements change, specification delays, size underestimate, and software tool underperformance.

- **[[Business Risks]]**  
  These risks affect the broader business environment or market.  
  Examples include technology change and product competition.
