- **[[Waterfall Model]]** 
    Linear, step-by-step process. Each phase must be finished before the next begins.

- **V-Model**  
    Extension of [[Waterfall Model]]. Every development stage has a corresponding testing stage.

- [[Extreme Programming (XP)]]
	Agile-focused ([[Agile Model]]), with short cycles, pair programming, continuous testing, and constant customer feedback. Prioritises adaptability and simplicity.

- **Incremental Model**  
    Software built and delivered in small, usable parts (increments).

- **Spiral Model**  
    Iterative ([[iteration]]) cycles with strong focus on [[risk analysis]] and refinement.

- [[Agile Model]]
    Flexible, iterative ([[iteration]]), emphasises collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid delivery.

- **RAD (Rapid Application Development)**  
    Fast prototyping and iterations, prioritising speed over structure.

- **Big Bang Model**  
    Minimal planning, all resources thrown in. Product emerges at the end, chaotic but simple.
    
- [[Unified Process (UP)]]  
	Iterative ([[iteration]]) and architecture-centric. Divides development into four phases: [[Inception]], [[elaboration]], [[construction]] and [[transition]].
