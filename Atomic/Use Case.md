A use-case describes a specific way a user (or another system) interacts with a system to achieve a particular goal. Use-cases capture the functional requirements of a system by outlining the detailed steps involved in each interaction, helping to clarify system behavior from the user's perspective.

## Purpose

- Clarifies how the system should behave from the user's perspective.
- Helps identify and document functional requirements.
- Serves as a foundation for system design, testing, and user documentation.
- Facilitates communication between stakeholders, developers, and testers.
- Provides a basis for validating that the system meets user needs.

## Structure

A typical use-case includes the following elements:

- **Name:** The goal or function the use-case represents (e.g., "Borrow Book").
- **ID:** A unique identifier for easy reference (e.g., UC-01).
- **Participating Actors:** The users or external systems involved, including primary and secondary actors.
- **Pre-conditions:** Conditions that must be true before the use-case can start.
- **Flow of Events:** A detailed, step-by-step scenario describing the interaction between actors and the system.
- **Post-conditions:** The state of the system after the use-case completes successfully.
- **Alternative Flows:** Variations, exceptions, or error conditions that may occur during the interaction.
- **Special Requirements:** Any non-functional requirements or constraints relevant to the use-case.

## Formats

Use-cases can be documented in different levels of detail depending on the audience and purpose:

- **Brief:** A concise one-paragraph summary of the use-case.
- **Casual:** A more descriptive narrative with main flow and alternative scenarios, written in everyday language.
- **Fully Dressed:** A comprehensive document including all steps, pre/post-conditions, alternative flows, special requirements, and any assumptions.

## Use-Case Diagrams

Use-case diagrams are a type of UML diagram that visually represent use-cases, actors, and their interactions with the system. They provide a high-level overview of system functionality and user interactions. For more details, see [[Use-Case Diagram]].

## Use-Cases vs User Stories

|         | Use-Case                                 | User Story                                     |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Format  | Step-by-step scenario                    | Short sentence (“As a user, I want… so that…”) |
| Focus   | How the system and user interact         | What the user wants and why                    |
| Detail  | Detailed, includes all steps and options | Brief, high-level                              |
| Example | Borrow Book (with steps)                 | As a member, I want to borrow a book…          |

## Guidelines for Finding Use-Cases

1. **Define the system boundary:** Clearly identify what is inside and outside the system.
2. **Identify primary actors and their goals:** Determine who uses the system and what they want to achieve.
3. **Define use-cases that satisfy user goals:** Each use-case should represent a goal-oriented interaction that helps an actor achieve their objective.
4. **Consider alternative and exceptional flows:** Think about what can go wrong or different paths the interaction might take.
5. **Validate with stakeholders:** Review use-cases with users and stakeholders to ensure completeness and accuracy.

## Linking Use-Cases to Requirements

- Each use-case should be traceable to one or more functional requirements.
- This traceability helps ensure all requirements are covered and facilitates managing changes.
- Use-cases can also help identify gaps or conflicts in requirements.

## Difference Between Brief, Casual, and Fully Dressed Use Cases

Use-cases can be documented at varying levels of detail depending on the audience and purpose:

- A **brief use case** is a concise, one-paragraph summary that captures the essence of the interaction. It highlights the main goal and the key steps without going into detail. Brief use cases are useful for quick overviews, early brainstorming, or when communicating high-level functionality to stakeholders who do not need the full complexity.

- A **casual use case** is written in an informal, narrative style that tells the story of how a user interacts with the system to achieve a goal. It typically includes the main flow of events and some alternative scenarios but avoids technical jargon or exhaustive detail. Casual use cases are easy to read and understand, making them useful for early discussions with stakeholders or for capturing high-level functionality without overwhelming detail.

- A **fully dressed use case** is a formal, detailed document that covers every aspect of the interaction. It includes explicit pre-conditions, post-conditions, all possible alternative flows, exception handling, special requirements, and assumptions. This level of detail supports thorough analysis, precise system design, comprehensive testing, and clear documentation. Fully dressed use cases are essential when accuracy and completeness are critical, such as in complex systems or regulated environments.

### Example Brief Use Case

**Title:** Borrow Book

A library member searches the catalog, finds a book, and borrows it if available; the system records the loan and sets a due date.
****
### Example Casual Use Case

**Title:** Borrow Book from Library

Imagine you are a library member who wants to borrow a book. You start by searching the library catalog online to find the book you want. Once you find it, you check if it’s available. If it is, you place a hold on the book or go to the library to check it out. The librarian verifies your membership and the book’s availability, then records the loan in the system. You receive a due date for returning the book. If the book is not available, you can choose to be notified when it becomes available or look for an alternative. This interaction ensures you can borrow books efficiently and keep track of your loans.

System records item, displays description/price/running total.<br>5. System presents total with taxes.<br>6. Cashier informs customer of total.<br>7. Customer pays; System handles payment.<br>8. System logs sale, updates accounting and inventory.<br>9. System presents receipt.<br>10. Customer leaves with goods and receipt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Extensions (Alternative Flows)**      | **a. Manager override:** Enter manager mode, perform operation, revert to cashier mode.<br>**b. System failure:** Cashier restarts system, recovers state; if unrecoverable, start new sale.<br>**1a. Resume suspended sale:** Cashier retrieves sale by ID; error if not found.<br>**2-4a. Tax-exempt status:** Cashier enters status; system records for tax calculation.<br>**3a. Invalid item ID:** System signals error; cashier may retry manually or request manager override.<br>**3b. Multiple items same category:** Enter category and quantity.<br>**3c. Manual entry for special items:** Cashier enters category and price.<br>**3-6a. Remove item:** Cashier removes item; manager override if price exceeds limit.<br>**3-6b. Cancel sale:** Cashier cancels sale.<br>**3-6c. Suspend sale:** System saves sale; suspend receipt issued.<br>**4a. Override price:** Manager approves; cashier enters new price.<br>**5a. Tax system failure:** Restart service; if not, cashier manually calculates.<br>**5b. Customer discount:** Enter identification; system applies discount.<br>**5c. Customer credit:** Apply up to total sale.<br>**6a. Insufficient cash:** Ask for alternate payment; may cancel sale.<br>**7a. Cash payment:** Cashier enters tendered amount; system calculates balance.<br>**7b.
