Initial requirements are the first set of requirements captured during the [[Inception]] phase to establish project feasibility and scope

They represent approximately 10-20% of the total [[Functional Requirements]] - just enough to understand what the system should do and whether it's worth building

Initial requirements focus on the most important and highest-risk functionality to support key project decisions

## Characteristics

- **High-level** - Broad overview rather than detailed specifications
- **Risk-focused** - Emphasize functionality that poses the greatest technical or business risks
- **Value-focused** - Include the most important capabilities that justify the project
- **Feasibility-oriented** - Sufficient detail to assess whether the project is viable
- **Foundation** - Basis for more detailed requirements development in [[Elaboration]]

## Purpose in [[Inception]]

### Project Feasibility
- **Scope understanding** - What does the system need to do at a high level?
- **Size estimation** - How big and complex is this likely to be?
- **Technical feasibility** - Can this be built with available technology and skills?
- **Business case validation** - Do the requirements justify the investment?

### Stakeholder Alignment
- **Shared vision** - Ensure all [[Stakeholder]]s understand the system's purpose
- **Scope boundaries** - Clarify what will and won't be included
- **Priority establishment** - Identify which requirements are most critical
- **Expectation management** - Set realistic expectations for system capabilities

### Project Planning
- **Resource estimation** - What skills, people, and technology will be needed?
- **Timeline estimation** - How long might this project take?
- **Risk identification** - What are the biggest challenges and unknowns?
- **Architecture planning** - What are the major architectural implications?

## Content of Initial Requirements

### Core [[Functional Requirements]]
- **Essential [[Use Case]]s** that define the system's primary purpose
- **Key business processes** that the system must support
- **Critical user interactions** that determine system success
- **Integration requirements** with existing systems

### Major [[Non-Functional Requirements]]
- **Performance expectations** that affect architecture decisions
- **Security requirements** that impact system design
- **Scalability needs** that influence technology choices
- **Compliance requirements** that constrain solution options

### Constraints and Assumptions
- **Technology constraints** - Must use specific platforms or tools
- **Business constraints** - Budget, timeline, or resource limitations
- **Regulatory constraints** - Legal or industry requirements
- **Integration constraints** - Must work with existing systems

## Sources of Initial Requirements

### [[Stakeholder]] Interviews
- **Key users** who will interact with the system daily
- **Business sponsors** who are funding the project
- **Domain experts** who understand the business processes
- **Technical stakeholders** who manage existing systems

### Existing Documentation
- **Business process documentation** describing current operations
- **Existing system documentation** for systems being replaced or integrated
- **Industry standards** that apply to the domain
- **Regulatory documentation** that defines compliance requirements

### Market Research
- **Competitive analysis** of similar systems in the market
- **Industry best practices** for this type of system
- **User experience research** about what users expect
- **Technology trends** that might influence solution approach

## Documentation Format

### High-Level Format
- **Brief descriptions** rather than detailed specifications
- **User story format** for functional requirements ("As a... I want... so that...")
- **Constraint statements** for limitations and requirements
- **[[Use Case]] briefs** for key system interactions

### Example Initial Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- Users must be able to search for products by category and keyword
- The system must process credit card payments securely
- Customers must be able to track their order status online
- The system must generate daily sales reports for management

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- System must support 1000 concurrent users during peak periods
- All customer data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest
- System must integrate with existing inventory management system
- User interface must be accessible to users with disabilities

#### Constraints
- Must be built using company-standard Java technology stack
- Must be completed within 12-month timeline
- Must comply with PCI DSS requirements for payment processing
- Must integrate with existing Active Directory for user authentication

## Prioritization

### [[MoSCoW]] Categorization
- **Must Have** - Requirements essential for system success
- **Should Have** - Important requirements that add significant value
- **Could Have** - Nice-to-have features if time and budget allow
- **Won't Have** - Features explicitly excluded from this release

### Risk-Based Prioritization
- **High Risk, High Value** - Address these first in [[Elaboration]]
- **High Risk, Low Value** - Understand early to make architecture decisions
- **Low Risk, High Value** - Core functionality that's well understood
- **Low Risk, Low Value** - May be deferred or eliminated

## Evolution to Detailed Requirements

### [[Elaboration]] Phase Expansion
- **Detail the 10-20%** - Flesh out the initial requirements with full specifications
- **Add the next 50-60%** - Identify and detail additional requirements
- **Refine understanding** - Correct misunderstandings from initial requirements
- **Update priorities** - Adjust based on deeper understanding of needs and constraints

### Traceability Maintenance
- **Link to detailed requirements** - Show how detailed requirements relate to initial ones
- **Track changes** - Document how understanding evolved from initial to detailed
- **Validate coverage** - Ensure all initial requirements are addressed in detail
- **Justify scope changes** - Explain any additions or deletions from initial scope

## Common Mistakes

### Too Much Detail
- **Premature specification** - Trying to capture complete requirements too early
- **Analysis paralysis** - Spending too much time on requirements instead of validating feasibility
- **Over-commitment** - Making detailed promises based on incomplete understanding

### Too Little Detail  
- **Insufficient scope definition** - Not enough detail to assess feasibility
- **Missing critical constraints** - Overlooking requirements that significantly impact solution
- **Vague requirements** - Statements too general to guide decision-making

### Wrong Focus
- **Easy requirements first** - Focusing on well-understood, low-risk requirements
- **Feature creep** - Including nice-to-have features instead of focusing on core needs
- **Technical bias** - Emphasizing technical requirements over business needs

## Success Criteria

### Feasibility Assessment
- **Business case confirmed** - Requirements justify the proposed investment
- **Technical approach validated** - Solution approach is technically feasible
- **Resource requirements understood** - Know what skills, people, and technology are needed
- **Major risks identified** - Understand the biggest challenges facing the project

### [[Stakeholder]] Alignment
- **Shared understanding** - All key [[Stakeholder]]s agree on system scope and purpose
- **Realistic expectations** - [[Stakeholder]]s understand what can and cannot be delivered
- **Priority consensus** - Agreement on which requirements are most important
- **Support maintained** - [[Stakeholder]]s remain committed to the project

Initial requirements are the foundation for all subsequent requirements work and play a crucial role in determining whether a project should proceed and how it should be approached.
