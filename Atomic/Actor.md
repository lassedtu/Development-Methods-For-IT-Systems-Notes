An actor is a person, group, or external system that interacts with a system but is not part of the system itself. Actors use the system to achieve a goal or are used by the system to perform certain tasks.

## Purpose

- Represents external entities that interact with the system in [[Use-Case Diagram]]s.
- Helps identify who or what initiates or participates in system functions.
- Clarifies system boundaries by distinguishing what is inside vs. outside the system.

## Types of Actors

- **Primary Actor:**  
    The main user or system that initiates interactions to achieve a goal (e.g., a customer placing an order).

- **Secondary Actor:**  
    Supports the system or helps the primary actor, often providing a service or information (e.g., a payment gateway, a database).

- **Offstage (Tertiary) Actor:**  
    Does not interact directly with the system but is affected by its outcome or has an interest in it (e.g., a manager who receives reports, a government agency monitoring compliance).

## In Use-Case Diagrams

- Actors are shown as stick figures outside the system boundary.
- Actors are connected to the use-cases they interact with via solid lines.
