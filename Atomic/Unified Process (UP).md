UP is both **iterative** (repeats over time) and **incremental** (builds features step by step).

**Phases:**

1. [[Inception]]
2. [[Elaboration]]
3. [[Construction]]
4. [[Transition]]

- [[Construction]] is the longest phase, where most programming happens.
- Activities like business modelling and requirements gathering are most intense in the early phases and taper off later.

### Executable Architecture Baseline

- A partial implementation of the system.
- Created during elaboration.
- Serves as the foundation for further development.

### Fundamental Principles of UP

- **Iterative & Incremental** — system grows with each iteration. ([[Iterative]])
- **Use Case–Driven** — focus on end-user functionality. ([[Use Case]])
- **Risk-Driven** — identify and address risks in every iteration.
- **Architecture-Centric** — focus on building, testing, and stabilising the core architecture.

### Advantages of Iterative Development

- Short, manageable steps.
- Visible progress early.
- Adaptable to changing requirements.
- Early feedback and user involvement.
- High-risk issues addressed first.

Phases are not repeated within one iteration.

- You can’t deploy before transition.
- You can’t construct before elaboration.
