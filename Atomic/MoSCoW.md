The MoSCoW model is a simple way to prioritise requirements or features in a project. It helps teams decide what is most important to deliver first, and what can wait until later. Each letter in MoSCoW stands for a different level of priority.

### The four categories of MoSCoW

- **Must have**
    These are the requirements that are absolutely essential for the system or project to work. If any "Must have" is missing, the project will fail or not be usable.  
    **Example**: The system must allow users to log in securely.

- **Should have**
    These requirements are important, but not critical. The system can still function without them, but they add significant value and should be included if possible.  
    **Example**: The system should allow users to reset their password via email.

- **Could have**
    These are nice-to-have features. They are not essential and can be left out if there is not enough time or resources. They are often enhancements that improve user experience.  
    **Example**: The system could allow users to customise their dashboard.

- **Won’t have (this time)**
    These are requirements that have been agreed will not be included in this release or iteration. They may be considered for the future, but are not a priority now.  
    **Example**: The system won’t have integration with third-party analytics tools in the first release.
