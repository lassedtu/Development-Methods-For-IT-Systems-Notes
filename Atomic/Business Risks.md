Business risks affect the broader business environment, market, or organisation.

They influence the viability and success of the project beyond technical or project concerns.

#### Examples

- **Technology change**  
  The underlying technology on which the system is built is superseded by new technology, making the product obsolete or requiring redesign.

- **Product competition**  
  A competitive product is marketed before the system is completed, reducing market share or demand.

Managing business risks involves market research, monitoring external factors, and aligning the project with business strategy.
