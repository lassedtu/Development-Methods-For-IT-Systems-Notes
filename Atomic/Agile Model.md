Agile is an **umbrella term** for modern, flexible methodologies:
- [[Extreme Programming (XP)]]
- [[Feature-Driven Development (FDD)]]
- [[Unified Process (UP)]] ← _focus of our textbook
- [[Scrum]
- Kanban


**Key Idea:** Development is split into **iterations** (short, fixed-length mini-projects).

- Each [[iteration]] has its own requirements, design, implementation, and testing.
- Iterations evolve the product step by step.

**Pros:**
- Early feedback reduces risks.
- Flexible and adaptable.

**Cons:**
- Finding the right [[iteration]] length can be challenging (typically 2–6 weeks).
