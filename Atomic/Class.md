Here’s an expanded version of your note that keeps your style and language, but adds relevant details about classes in IT system development, including conceptual classes, class diagrams, relationships, and general design considerations:

---

# Classes

A class is a blueprint for a concept in a domain. It defines the structure and behavior for objects of that type. Classes represent things like Human, Animal, Student, or any entity relevant to the problem.

In IT system development, classes are used in both **conceptual modeling** (thinking about the domain) and **implementation** (writing code). They help structure a system, define responsibilities, and model real-world relationships.

## Conceptual Classes

Conceptual classes are used in the early stages of system design. They represent ideas or entities in the problem domain, not the code itself. Conceptual classes help understand the system, identify key entities, and define relationships between them.

Example: In a university system:

- **Student** – represents students
    
- **Course** – represents courses offered
    
- **Teacher** – represents teaching staff
    

These classes are abstract ideas used to understand the system before coding.

## Class Diagrams

Class diagrams are part of [[Unified Modelling Language (UML)]] and visually represent classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. They are used to plan and communicate the structure of a system.

Key elements of class diagrams:

- **Classes** with attributes (fields) and methods
- **Relationships** such as associations, inheritance, and dependencies
- **Multiplicity** to show how many objects are involved in a relationship

Example:

```
Student ---enrolledIn---> Course
Teacher ---teaches---> Course
```

## Structure of a Class

A class contains two main parts:

1. **Variables or fields** that store the state or data
2. **Methods** that define the behavior or actions

Example of a Student class in Java style:

```java
public class Student {
    private String studentName
    private String studentID
    private Date dateOfBirth

    public Student(String studentName, String studentID, Date dateOfBirth) {
        this.studentName = studentName
        this.studentID = studentID
        this.dateOfBirth = dateOfBirth
    }

    public void enrolInCourse() {
        // code to enrol student in a course
    }

    public void unenrolInCourse() {
        // code to unenrol student from a course
    }

    public void findStudyGroup() {
        // code to find a study group
    }
}
```

## Objects

An object is an instance of a class. The class acts like a datatype and the object is a variable of that datatype with specific values. Objects hold real data and interact in the system.

Example:  
Class: Pasta with fields shape size length width  
Object: Spaghetti with shape tube size big length long width thin

This shows how a class is a template and an object is a concrete example.

## Constructors

A constructor is a special method called when an object is created. It initializes the object's fields and sets its initial state.

Example constructor in a Car class:

```java
public class Car {
    private String make
    private String model
    private int year

    public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
        this.make = make
        this.model = model
        this.year = year
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println(year + " " + make + " " + model)
    }
}
```

Creating an object:  
`Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)`

## Relationships Between Classes

- **Association:** simple connection between classes
- **Aggregation:** “has-a” relationship where one class contains another but both can exist independently
- **Composition:** “owns-a” relationship where one class contains another and its lifecycle depends on the owner
- **Inheritance:** “is-a” relationship where a class inherits fields and methods from another class
- **Dependency:** one class depends on another temporarily

Example:

```
Teacher ---teaches---> Course  (Association)
Course ---has--- Student  (Aggregation)
Car ---engine--- Engine  (Composition)
Student ---is-a--- Person  (Inheritance)
```

## Naming Conventions

- Class names start with a capital letter
- Class names are nouns and singular
- Object names start with a lowercase letter

Examples:  
Class: Student Teacher Pasta Car  
Object: student teacher spaghetti myCar
