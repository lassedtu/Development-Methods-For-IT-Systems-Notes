Risk analysis is the process of evaluating identified [[Risk|risks]] to understand their likelihood and potential impact on the project, product, or business.

It helps prioritise which risks need the most attention and guides planning of mitigation strategies.

Two key factors are assessed for each risk:

- **Probability** (1 to 5)  
  How likely the risk is to occur, where 1 means very unlikely and 5 means very likely.

- **Impact** (1 to 5)  
  How severe the consequences would be if the risk occurs, where 1 means minimal impact and 5 means critical impact.

By combining probability and impact, we can focus on risks that pose the greatest threat.

| Requirements change            | 4                 | 5            | Late discovery of new features needed to stand out can disrupt planning and increase workload | Use clear initial requirements and frequent reviews |
| Staff turnover                 | 3                 | 4            | Key developers leaving causes delays and loss of knowledge                                    | Cross-training and documentation to reduce impact   |
| **[[Product Risks]]**          |                   |              |                                                                                               |                                                     |

| Integration challenges         | 3                 | 4            | Difficulties integrating with contacts or media sharing platforms                             | Early integration testing and modular design        |
| **[[Business Risks]]**         |                   |              |                                                                                               |                                                     |

This analysis helps the team focus on high probability and high impact risks first.

It also supports communication with stakeholders by clearly showing risk priorities and planned responses.
