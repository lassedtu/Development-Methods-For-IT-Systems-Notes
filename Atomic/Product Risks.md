Product risks concern the quality, performance, and functionality of the product being developed.

They affect whether the product meets requirements and satisfies users.

#### Examples

- **Requirements change**  
  Frequent or late changes to requirements cause rework and uncertainty.

- **Specification delays**  
  Delays in receiving detailed specifications hinder development and testing.

- **Size underestimate**  
  The size or complexity of the system is underestimated, leading to insufficient resources or time.

- **Software tool underperformance**  
  Software tools that support the product do not perform as anticipated, reducing productivity or quality.

Reducing product risks requires thorough requirements analysis, careful design, testing, and user feedback.
