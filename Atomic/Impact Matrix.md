An impact matrix is a visual tool used in [[Risk]] management to categorise and prioritise risks based on their probability and impact.

It is usually displayed as a grid where one axis represents the probability of a risk occurring and the other axis represents the impact if it does occur.

Each risk is placed in the matrix according to its assessed probability and impact scores.

The matrix helps quickly identify which risks are most critical and require immediate attention or mitigation.

Risks in the high probability and high impact area are the highest priority.

Risks with low probability and low impact are lower priority and may be monitored with less urgency.

Using an impact matrix supports clear communication among team members and stakeholders by providing a simple overview of risk severity.
