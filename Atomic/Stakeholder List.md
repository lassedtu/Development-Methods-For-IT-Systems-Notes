A stakeholder list is an artifact created during the [[inception]] phase that identifies all individuals, groups, or organisations with an interest in the project. [[Stakeholder]]s can influence the project, be affected by its outcome, or participate in its development.

## Purpose

- Ensures all relevant parties are identified early.
- Helps gather requirements, feedback, and support from the right people.
- Facilitates communication and alignment throughout the project.

## Typical Contents

- **[[Stakeholder]] Name/Group**
- **Role or Interest in the Project**
- **Contact Information (if relevant)**
- **Influence/Impact Level**
- **Key Concerns or Expectations**

## Example Stakeholders

- Funding partners
- Private organisations
- Schools, universities
- General population
- End users
- Project managers
- Government agencies

## Context

The stakeholder list is a key artifact in the inception phase. It is used alongside the [[Vision]], [[Business Case]], and other inception artifacts to make sure that all perspectives are considered from the start.
