The **Waterfall model** was the first structured approach to software development.
- Activities occur in **linear, sequential phases**.
- Once you move forward, you cannot go back (like a real waterfall).

**Phases:**  
Requirements → Design → Implementation → Verification → Maintenance

**Pros:**
- Easy to understand.
- Easy to track (linear and sequential).
- Well documented (all requirements defined upfront).

**Cons:**
- Inflexible (requirements fixed at the start).
- Hard to adapt to changes in goals.
- Testing happens late in the process.
