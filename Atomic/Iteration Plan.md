An iteration plan is a short document that lists what the team will work on during the next development cycle called an [[iteration]]

It includes the tasks to be done who will do them and the goals for that period

The plan helps the team stay organised and focused on what needs to be completed in each step of the project

## Purpose of an iteration plan

- Provide clear focus for the team on the immediate work ahead

- Break down the project into manageable chunks or cycles

- Ensure everyone understands their responsibilities and deadlines

- Track progress and adjust plans as needed in future iterations

- Facilitate communication among team members and stakeholders

## Key components of an iteration plan

- **Iteration goals**  
  What the team aims to achieve by the end of the iteration

- **Tasks or user stories**  
  Specific work items to be completed during the iteration (see [[Use Case]])

- **Assigned team members**  
  Who is responsible for each task or story

- **Estimated effort or time**  
  How long each task is expected to take

- **Dependencies and risks**  
  Any factors that could affect completion of tasks

- **Acceptance criteria**  
  Conditions that must be met for tasks to be considered done

## How to create an iteration plan

1. Review the product backlog or requirements to select items for the iteration

2. Define clear goals that align with the overall project vision

3. Break down selected items into smaller tasks if needed

4. Assign tasks to team members based on skills and availability

5. Estimate effort and set realistic deadlines

6. Identify dependencies and potential risks

7. Agree on acceptance criteria for each task

8. Document the plan and share it with the team and stakeholders

## Examples of iteration goals

- Implement user login and registration features

- Complete initial design of the main user interface

- Develop and test the payment processing module

- Fix critical bugs reported in the last release

## Example iteration plan outline

| Task                     | Assigned To | Estimated Time | Acceptance Criteria                     |
|--------------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Design login screen      | Alice       | 2 days        | Screen matches wireframes and is responsive |
| Implement login backend  | Bob         | 3 days        | Users can log in with valid credentials |
| Write unit tests for login | Carol     | 1 day         | 90% code coverage and all tests pass  |
| Review and deploy login  | Team        | 1 day         | No critical bugs and deployment successful |

## Benefits of iteration planning

- Keeps the team aligned and motivated

- Helps manage scope and avoid overload

- Enables early detection of issues and risks

- Supports continuous delivery and improvement

- Improves transparency and accountability

## Common challenges and tips

- Avoid overloading the iteration with too many tasks

- Keep goals realistic and achievable

- Communicate regularly and update the plan as needed

- Use tools like task boards or software to track progress

- Involve the whole team in planning for better commitment
