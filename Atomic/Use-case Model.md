A use-case model is a comprehensive collection of all [[Use Case]]s, [[Actor]]s, and their relationships that describes the complete functional requirements of a system

It provides a complete picture of how the system will be used and what functionality it must provide from the user's perspective

The use-case model serves as the primary artifact for capturing and communicating [[Functional Requirements]] throughout the development process

## Components

### [[Use Case]]s
- **Individual scenarios** that describe how [[Actor]]s interact with the system
- **Goal-oriented interactions** that deliver value to the [[Primary Actor]]
- **Detailed descriptions** of system behavior and user interactions
- **Complete coverage** of all system functionality

### [[Actor]]s
- **[[Primary Actor]]s** who initiate interactions to achieve goals
- **[[Secondary Actor]]s** who provide services and support to the system
- **[[Offstage Actor]]s** who are affected by system outcomes but don't directly interact

### Relationships
- **[[Include Relationship]]s** for shared, mandatory functionality
- **[[Extend Relationship]]s** for optional or exceptional behavior
- **Generalization relationships** for specialized [[Actor]]s or [[Use Case]]s
- **Associations** showing which [[Actor]]s participate in which [[Use Case]]s

### [[System Boundary]]
- **Scope definition** separating what's inside the system from what's outside
- **Interface clarification** showing where the system interacts with external entities
- **Responsibility allocation** between the system and external [[Actor]]s

## Purpose and Benefits

### Requirements Capture
- **Complete functional coverage** - All system functionality is captured in [[Use Case]]s
- **User perspective** - Requirements are described from the viewpoint of people who will use the system
- **Traceability** - Requirements can be traced from business needs through [[Use Case]]s to implementation
- **Validation** - [[Stakeholder]]s can validate that all their needs are represented

### Communication Tool
- **[[Stakeholder]] communication** - Business people can understand and validate [[Use Case]]s
- **Developer guidance** - Provides clear specification of what system must do
- **Tester foundation** - [[Use Case]]s become the basis for system testing
- **Documentation** - Serves as primary functional specification for the system

### Project Planning
- **Work breakdown** - [[Use Case]]s can be assigned to iterations and releases
- **Estimation basis** - Size and complexity can be estimated from [[Use Case]]s
- **Progress tracking** - Completion of [[Use Case]]s shows development progress
- **Risk assessment** - Complex or uncertain [[Use Case]]s highlight project risks

## Development Process

### Creation Activities
1. **Identify [[Actor]]s** - Who will use or interact with the system?
2. **Define [[System Boundary]]** - What is inside vs outside the system?
3. **Find [[Use Case]]s** - What goals do [[Actor]]s want to achieve?
4. **Describe [[Use Case]]s** - How do [[Actor]]s and system interact?
5. **Define relationships** - How do [[Use Case]]s and [[Actor]]s relate to each other?
6. **Validate model** - Does it completely capture system requirements?

### Evolution Through Phases
- **[[Inception]]** - Create initial use-case model with key [[Actor]]s and high-level [[Use Case]]s (10-20% detail)
- **[[Elaboration]]** - Develop detailed use-case model covering most functionality (60-80% detail)
- **[[Construction]]** - Complete and refine use-case model, implement [[Use Case]]s
- **[[Transition]]** - Validate use-case model against actual system behavior

## Documentation Levels

### Brief Use-Case Model
- **High-level overview** with main [[Actor]]s and [[Use Case]]s
- **Simple [[Use-Case Diagram]]** showing key relationships
- **One-paragraph descriptions** of major [[Use Case]]s
- **Suitable for** initial planning and [[Stakeholder]] communication

### Casual Use-Case Model
- **Narrative descriptions** of [[Use Case]]s in everyday language
- **Main flow documentation** with basic alternative scenarios
- **Clear [[Actor]] definitions** and responsibilities
- **Appropriate for** most projects and detailed planning

### Fully Dressed Use-Case Model
- **Complete [[Use Case]] specifications** with all sections detailed
- **Comprehensive alternative flows** and exception handling
- **Detailed [[Actor]] descriptions** and relationships
- **Essential for** complex systems and formal development processes

## Quality Criteria

### Completeness
- **All [[Actor]]s identified** - Every type of user or external system
- **All [[Use Case]]s captured** - Every way the system provides value
- **All relationships documented** - How [[Use Case]]s and [[Actor]]s relate
- **System boundary clear** - What's included vs external

### Consistency
- **Uniform [[Use Case]] format** - Same structure and detail level
- **Consistent terminology** - Terms used consistently across all [[Use Case]]s
- **Aligned relationships** - [[Include Relationship]]s and [[Extend Relationship]]s make sense
- **Compatible with [[Domain Model]]** - Business concepts align between models

### Correctness
- **Accurate [[Actor]] goals** - [[Use Case]]s actually help [[Actor]]s achieve their objectives
- **Realistic interactions** - Scenarios reflect how system will actually be used
- **Valid relationships** - [[Include Relationship]]s and [[Extend Relationship]]s are properly applied
- **Testable [[Use Case]]s** - Each [[Use Case]] can be tested and validated

## Common Patterns

### CRUD Operations
Many systems have [[Use Case]]s following Create, Read, Update, Delete patterns:
- Create New Customer
- View Customer Details  
- Update Customer Information
- Delete Customer Account

### Workflow [[Use Case]]s
Business processes often span multiple [[Use Case]]s:
- Submit Expense Report → Review Expense Report → Approve Expense Report → Process Payment

### Administrative [[Use Case]]s
Systems typically need management and maintenance [[Use Case]]s:
- Manage User Accounts
- Generate Reports
- Configure System Settings
- Monitor System Performance

## Integration with Other Models

### [[Domain Model]]
- **Concepts alignment** - [[Use Case]]s reference concepts defined in [[Domain Model]]
- **Data requirements** - [[Use Case]]s show what information the [[Domain Model]] must track
- **Business rules** - [[Use Case]]s implement rules defined in the [[Domain Model]]

### Architecture
- **Use-case realization** - How architectural components implement [[Use Case]] functionality
- **Interface definition** - [[Use Case]]s define what interfaces the architecture must provide
- **Performance requirements** - [[Use Case]] volumes and timing affect architectural decisions

### Test Cases
- **Test scenario basis** - [[Use Case]]s become foundation for system test cases
- **Acceptance criteria** - [[Use Case]] success conditions define acceptance tests
- **Coverage measurement** - Test coverage can be measured against [[Use Case]] coverage

## Tools and Techniques

### Modeling Tools
- **UML tools** for creating [[Use-Case Diagram]]s and managing relationships
- **Requirements management tools** for linking [[Use Case]]s to other artifacts
- **Collaboration tools** for [[Stakeholder]] review and feedback
- **Version control** for tracking changes to the use-case model

### Validation Techniques
- **[[Stakeholder]] reviews** to confirm [[Actor]]s and [[Use Case]]s are complete and correct
- **Walkthrough sessions** to trace through [[Use Case]] scenarios
- **Prototype validation** using early system versions to test [[Use Case]]s
- **Cross-reference analysis** to ensure consistency with other requirements

The use-case model is the cornerstone artifact for understanding and specifying what a system must do, serving as the bridge between business needs and technical implementation.
