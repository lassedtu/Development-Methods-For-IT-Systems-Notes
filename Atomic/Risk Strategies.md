Managing risks effectively requires choosing appropriate strategies to handle each identified [[Risk]].

Common risk strategies include:

- **Transfer**  
  Pass on responsibility for the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance, outsourcing).

- **Accept**  
  Take the chance and accept the risk without specific action, often when the risk impact is low.

- **Mitigate**  
  Take actions to minimize the consequences or likelihood of the risk.

- **Eliminate**  
  Remove the risk entirely by changing the project plan or approach.
