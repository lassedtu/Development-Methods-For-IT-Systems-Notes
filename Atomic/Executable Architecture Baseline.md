An executable architecture baseline is a partial implementation of the system that demonstrates the core architectural decisions and serves as the foundation for further development

It is created during the [[Elaboration]] phase and represents a working version of the system architecture that can be executed, tested, and validated

The baseline proves that the chosen architecture can support the system's most critical and risky [[Functional Requirements]] and [[Non-Functional Requirements]]

## Characteristics

- **Executable** - Can be run and tested, not just theoretical or on paper
- **Partial implementation** - Includes core architecture but not all functionality
- **Risk-focused** - Addresses the highest technical risks and architectural concerns
- **Foundation** - Serves as the base for all subsequent development work
- **Validated** - Proven to work through execution and testing

## Purpose and Goals

### Risk Mitigation
- **Prove architectural viability** - Demonstrate that the chosen architecture will work
- **Validate technology choices** - Confirm that selected technologies can deliver required capabilities
- **Test integration approaches** - Verify that system components can work together effectively
- **Address performance concerns** - Show that architecture can meet [[Non-Functional Requirements]]

### Foundation for Development
- **Establish development patterns** - Provide proven approaches for the development team
- **Define interfaces** - Specify how system components interact with each other
- **Set coding standards** - Demonstrate preferred implementation approaches
- **Guide team practices** - Show how development activities should be organized

### Communication Tool
- **Demonstrate progress** to [[Stakeholder]]s with tangible, working software
- **Facilitate architectural discussions** with concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
- **Enable early feedback** from users and [[Stakeholder]]s on system direction
- **Build confidence** in the project's technical feasibility

## Contents of the Baseline

### Architectural Significant [[Use Case]]s
- **Core business functionality** that exercises the primary architecture
- **Technically risky [[Use Case]]s** that test challenging architectural aspects
- **Performance-critical [[Use Case]]s** that validate [[Non-Functional Requirements]]
- **Integration [[Use Case]]s** that test connections with external systems

### Infrastructure Components
- **Database layer** with core data structures and access patterns
- **User interface framework** demonstrating the chosen UI technology
- **Business logic layer** showing how core processing will be organized
- **Integration layer** with key external systems or services

### Key Architectural Mechanisms
- **Error handling** approaches and patterns
- **Security mechanisms** for authentication and authorization
- **Transaction management** for data consistency
- **Logging and monitoring** capabilities for operational support

### Development Infrastructure
- **Build system** for compiling and packaging the application
- **Testing framework** for automated validation of functionality
- **Deployment procedures** for installing and configuring the system
- **Configuration management** for different environments

## Development Process

### Planning the Baseline
1. **Identify architectural risks** - What are the biggest unknowns or concerns?
2. **Select proving [[Use Case]]s** - Which [[Use Case]]s will test the most critical aspects?
3. **Define scope** - What minimum functionality will prove the architecture?
4. **Plan iterations** - How will the baseline be built incrementally?

### Building the Baseline
- **Start with riskiest elements** - Address the biggest architectural concerns first
- **Build end-to-end slices** - Implement complete paths through the architecture
- **Focus on interfaces** - Ensure clean separation between architectural layers
- **Implement infrastructure** - Build supporting systems needed for development

### Validating the Baseline
- **Execute core scenarios** - Run the implemented [[Use Case]]s successfully
- **Performance testing** - Verify that [[Non-Functional Requirements]] can be met
- **Stress testing** - Ensure architecture remains stable under load
- **Integration testing** - Confirm that all architectural components work together

## Relationship to Development Phases

### [[Elaboration]] Phase
- **Primary deliverable** - The baseline is the key outcome of [[Elaboration]]
- **Multiple iterations** - Built incrementally across several elaboration iterations
- **Risk reduction focus** - Each iteration addresses specific architectural risks
- **Foundation for [[Construction]]** - Prepares the architecture for full-scale development

### Transition to [[Construction]]
- **Stable foundation** - Architecture is proven and unlikely to change significantly
- **Development velocity** - Team can focus on functionality rather than architectural problems
- **Reduced risk** - Major technical risks have been addressed and resolved
- **Clear patterns** - Development team has proven approaches to follow

## Benefits

### Technical Benefits
- **Proven architecture** - Confidence that the system design will work
- **Early problem detection** - Architectural issues found when they're easier to fix
- **Technology validation** - Confirmation that chosen tools and frameworks are suitable
- **Performance baseline** - Understanding of system capabilities and limitations

### Project Benefits
- **Risk reduction** - Major technical uncertainties are resolved early
- **Stakeholder confidence** - Tangible proof that the project is on track
- **Development efficiency** - Team can work more productively with stable foundation
- **Quality foundation** - Later development builds on proven, tested architecture

### Team Benefits
- **Shared understanding** - All developers understand the architectural approach
- **Proven patterns** - Team has working examples of how to implement functionality
- **Development tools** - Infrastructure for building, testing, and deploying is in place
- **Early success** - Team gains confidence from delivering working software

## Common Challenges

### Scope Management
- **Too narrow** - Baseline doesn't address enough architectural concerns
- **Too broad** - Trying to implement too much functionality delays completion
- **Wrong focus** - Implementing easy functionality instead of risky architecture
- **Scope creep** - Adding non-essential features during baseline development

### Technical Challenges
- **Integration complexity** - Difficulty connecting different architectural components
- **Performance issues** - Architecture doesn't meet [[Non-Functional Requirements]]
- **Technology problems** - Chosen tools or frameworks don't work as expected
- **Scalability concerns** - Architecture works for small scale but won't scale up

### Stakeholder Management
- **Expectation management** - [[Stakeholder]]s may expect more functionality than is included
- **Progress measurement** - Difficult to show progress on architectural work
- **Value demonstration** - Hard to show business value of architectural foundation
- **Feedback incorporation** - Balancing [[Stakeholder]] input with architectural focus

## Success Criteria

### Technical Criteria
- **All architectural layers work together** successfully
- **Core [[Use Case]]s execute** without major technical problems
- **Performance targets met** for critical system operations
- **Integration points validated** with external systems

### Project Criteria
- **Major risks addressed** - Significant architectural uncertainties resolved
- **Team confidence** - Developers believe the architecture will support full system
- **[[Stakeholder]] acceptance** - Business stakeholders see value in demonstrated functionality
- **Schedule on track** - Baseline completed within planned [[Elaboration]] timeline

The executable architecture baseline is crucial for project success because it proves the fundamental technical approach before significant resources are committed to full system development.
