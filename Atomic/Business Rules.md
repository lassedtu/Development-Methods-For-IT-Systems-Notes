Business rules are statements that provide the criteria and conditions for making decisions. They define how things should be done or interpreted within the business context.

These rules capture policies, constraints, calculations, and definitions that govern the business. They help ensure consistency and correctness in business processes and decisions.

Business rules focus on the business logic and are independent of software implementation. Although they are not part of the software requirements, they influence how the software should behave.

Understanding business rules is important for designing systems that align with business needs. They can range from simple definitions to complex conditions involving multiple factors.

Typically, business rules come from domain experts, business analysts, or regulatory requirements.

### Example  
"Net sale is defined as the total sales price of an order before discounts, allowances, shipping, and other charges."

Other examples of business rules include:  
- Customers must be at least 18 years old to register.  
- Orders over 1000 dollars require manager approval.  
- Returns are accepted within 30 days of purchase.

Documenting business rules separately helps clarify what the business expects without mixing them with technical details. This separation supports better communication between business stakeholders and development teams.

## Characteristics

- **Business-focused** - Describe business policies and constraints, not technical implementation
- **Decision criteria** - Provide rules for making business decisions
- **Implementation-independent** - Define what should happen, not how it's implemented  
- **Traceable** - Can be traced to business policies, regulations, or organizational decisions
- **Measurable** - Often quantifiable and testable

## Purpose

- **Ensure consistency** in business processes and decisions across the organization
- **Capture business knowledge** in a formal, documented way
- **Guide system design** by specifying business logic requirements
- **Support compliance** with regulations, policies, and standards
- **Enable validation** of system behavior against business expectations

## Types of Business Rules

### Definitions
Rules that define business terms and concepts:
- "Net sale is defined as the total sales price of an order before discounts, allowances, shipping, and other charges"
- "A premium customer is one who has spent more than $10,000 in the past year"

### Constraints  
Rules that limit or restrict business operations:
- "Customers must be at least 18 years old to register"
- "Orders over $1000 require manager approval"
- "Returns are accepted within 30 days of purchase"

### Calculations
Rules that specify how values are computed:
- "Sales tax is calculated as order total Ã— local tax rate"
- "Shipping cost is based on weight, destination, and delivery speed"
- "Employee bonus is 5% of annual salary if performance rating exceeds 4.0"

### Process Rules
Rules that govern how business processes should work:
- "All new employees must complete safety training within 30 days"
- "Purchase orders must be approved before goods can be ordered"
- "Customer complaints must be responded to within 24 hours"

## Sources of Business Rules

### Internal Sources
- **Company policies** and procedures
- **Management decisions** and strategic directions  
- **Operational procedures** and best practices
- **Historical business practices** and traditions

### External Sources
- **Government regulations** and laws
- **Industry standards** and certifications
- **Contract requirements** with partners or customers
- **Professional guidelines** and ethical standards

## Examples by Domain

### E-commerce Business Rules
- Free shipping on orders over $50
- Loyalty points expire after 12 months of inactivity
- Credit card charges are processed only after inventory confirmation
- Refunds must be processed within 5 business days

### Library Business Rules
- Members can borrow maximum 5 books at one time
- Book loan period is 21 days with one renewal allowed
- Fines are charged at $0.25 per day for overdue books
- Lost book replacement cost is original price plus $10 processing fee

### Banking Business Rules
- Minimum account balance is $100 to avoid monthly fees
- ATM withdrawal limit is $500 per day
- International transfers require additional security verification
- Account is automatically closed after 12 months of inactivity

## Relationship to Requirements

### Influence on [[Functional Requirements]]
- Business rules often become [[Functional Requirements]] for the system
- System must enforce business rules through its functionality
- Validation logic in the system implements business rule checking

### Influence on [[Non-Functional Requirements]]  
- Performance rules affect system response time requirements
- Security rules influence access control and data protection requirements
- Availability rules affect uptime and reliability requirements

## Documentation Guidelines

### Clear Statement Format
- Use precise, unambiguous language
- Avoid technical jargon when describing business concepts
- Make rules testable and measurable when possible

### Business Rule Template
- **ID**: Unique identifier (BR-001)
- **Name**: Descriptive title for the rule
- **Statement**: Clear description of the rule
- **Source**: Who or what established this rule
- **Rationale**: Why this rule exists
- **Examples**: Concrete examples of the rule in action

### Example Documentation
```
ID: BR-001
Name: Customer Age Requirement
Statement: Customers must be at least 18 years old to create an account
Source: Company Policy, Legal Requirement
Rationale: Legal liability and contract law requirements
Example: A 17-year-old attempting to register will be rejected
```

## Separation from Technical Details

### What Business Rules Are
- Business policies and constraints
- Decision criteria and calculations
- Process requirements and definitions
- Compliance and regulatory requirements

### What Business Rules Are Not
- Database schema design decisions
- User interface layout requirements
- Technical implementation choices
- System architecture decisions

## Benefits of Documenting Business Rules

### For Business Stakeholders
- **Clear communication** of business expectations
- **Consistent application** of business policies
- **Audit trail** for business decisions
- **Change management** when business rules evolve

### For Development Teams
- **Clear requirements** for system behavior
- **Validation criteria** for testing system functionality
- **Design guidance** for implementing business logic
- **Traceability** from business needs to system features

## Common Mistakes

- **Mixing business rules with technical requirements** - Keep them separate
- **Making rules too vague** - "Reasonable time" instead of "within 24 hours"
- **Missing the business rationale** - Not explaining why the rule exists
- **Not maintaining rules** - Letting documented rules become outdated
- **Over-complicating simple rules** - Using complex language for simple concepts

## Evolution During Development

- **[[Inception]]**: Identify key business rules that affect system scope
- **[[Elaboration]]**: Detail business rules that influence system architecture and design
- **[[Construction]]**: Implement business rule validation and enforcement in system
- **[[Transition]]**: Validate that system correctly implements all business rules

## Relationship to Other Artifacts

- **Influence [[Use Case]]s** by defining how system should behave in different scenarios
- **Drive [[Functional Requirements]]** by specifying what system must enforce
- **Inform [[Domain Model]]** by defining business concepts and relationships
- **Guide [[Non-Functional Requirements]]** through performance and security rules
- **Support [[Risk]] management** by identifying compliance and operational risks

Business rules are fundamental to building systems that truly serve business needs and operate according to organizational policies and constraints.
