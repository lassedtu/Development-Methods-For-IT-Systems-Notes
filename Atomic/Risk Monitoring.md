Risk monitoring is the continuous process of checking that assumptions about [[Risk|risks]] remain valid throughout the project lifecycle.

It involves:

- Regularly reviewing risks at all project stages.

- Asking key questions such as:  
  - Is the risk becoming more or less probable?  
  - Have the effects of the risk changed?

- Watching for potential indicators of risk types:
