Project risks are risks related to the management and execution of the project itself.

They affect how well the project is planned, organised, and controlled.

#### Examples

- **Staff turnover**  
  Experienced staff will leave the project before it is finished, causing loss of knowledge and delays.

- **Management change**  
  Changes in company management bring different priorities that may affect project direction or funding.

- **Hardware unavailability**  
  Essential hardware needed for the project will not be delivered on schedule, causing delays.

- **Requirements change**  
  A larger number of changes to the requirements than anticipated disrupt planning and development.

- **Specification delays**  
  Specifications and essential interfaces are not available on time, slowing progress.

Managing project risks involves careful planning, realistic scheduling, clear communication, and monitoring progress regularly.
