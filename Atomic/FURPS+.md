FURPS+ is a model used to help organise and classify different types of requirements for a system or project. It covers both what the system should do and how well it should do it.

Each letter correlates to a different category of requirements that should be considered when designing a system

FURPS+ helps organize both [[Functional Requirements]] and [[Non-Functional Requirements]] in a systematic way

| Letter | Category       | Description                                              |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| F      | Functional     | What the system does (features, actions)                 |
| U      | Usability      | How easy and pleasant it is to use                       |
| R      | Reliability    | How dependable and consistent it is                      |
| P      | Performance    | How fast and efficient it is                             |
| S      | Supportability | How easy it is to maintain and support                   |
| +      | Plus           | Other requirements (constraints, interfaces, legal, etc) |

## F - [[Functional Requirements]]

These are the features and functions the system must perform. They describe what the system should do, such as processing data, authenticating users, generating reports, or sending notifications. [[Functional Requirements]] are usually written as "the system shallâ€¦" statements.

## U - Usability

Usability requirements focus on how easy and pleasant the system is to use. This includes the user interface design, accessibility, documentation, help features, and overall user experience. Usability answers questions like: Is the system intuitive? Can users learn it quickly? Is it accessible to people with disabilities?

These are part of [[Non-Functional Requirements]] that affect user satisfaction.

Examples:

- The system must provide online help.
- The interface should be easy to navigate for new users.

## R - Reliability

Reliability requirements specify how dependable the system must be. This includes availability (uptime), accuracy, error rates, recoverability, and how the system handles failures. Reliability is about making sure the system works correctly and consistently.

These are critical [[Non-Functional Requirements]] that affect system trustworthiness.

Examples:

- The system must be available 99.9% of the time.
- The system must recover from crashes within 2 minutes.

## P - Performance

Performance requirements describe how fast and efficiently the system should operate. This includes response times, throughput, resource usage, and scalability. Performance ensures the system can handle the expected workload.

These are essential [[Non-Functional Requirements]] that impact user experience.

Examples:

- The system must respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
- The system must support 1000 concurrent users.

## S - Supportability

Supportability (sometimes called Serviceability) requirements cover how easy it is to maintain, update, and support the system. This includes requirements for diagnostics, logging, configuration, monitoring, and documentation for support staff.

These are important [[Non-Functional Requirements]] for long-term system maintenance.

Examples:

- The system must log all errors for troubleshooting.
- The system should allow configuration changes without downtime.

## + (Plus)

The "+" in FURPS+ stands for additional categories that don't fit neatly into the first five. These can include:

- **Design constraints:** Specific technologies, platforms, or standards that must be used.
- **Implementation requirements:** Programming languages, tools, or methods.
- **Interface requirements:** How the system interacts with other systems.
- **Physical requirements:** Hardware, devices, or environmental needs.
- **Legal and regulatory requirements:** Compliance with laws or industry standards.

These additional requirements often become [[Business Rules]] or constraints that affect system design.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

FURPS+ is commonly used during:
- [[Inception]] phase to identify different types of requirements
- [[Elaboration]] phase to detail [[Non-Functional Requirements]]
- [[Supplementary Specification]] documentation to organize quality requirements
- Requirements analysis to ensure all aspects are considered

The model helps ensure that [[Use Case]]s capture not just what the system does ([[Functional Requirements]]) but also how well it does it ([[Non-Functional Requirements]]).
