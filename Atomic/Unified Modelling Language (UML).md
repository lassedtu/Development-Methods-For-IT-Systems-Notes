UML is a **visual language** for specifying, constructing, and documenting systems.

Two main groups of diagrams:

1. **Structure diagrams** - technical structure of the system.
2. **Behaviour diagrams** - system behaviour.

## Common UML Diagrams

- **Sequence / Interaction Diagram** → flow of messages between objects.

- **Class Diagram** → shows [[Class]] structure and relations, can be translated directly into code.

- **Domain Model** → visualises real-world concepts, less code-oriented.

# Disclaimer

- UML diagrams are for **understanding and communication**, not just documentation.
- Don’t overcomplicate: simple diagrams are best.
- More diagrams ≠ clearer understanding.
