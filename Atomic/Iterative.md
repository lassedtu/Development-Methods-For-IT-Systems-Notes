Iterative development is a software development approach where the project is divided into small, manageable cycles called iterations

Each iteration involves all the activities of software development: requirements analysis, design, implementation, and testing

The system evolves gradually through repeated cycles, with each iteration building upon the previous one to deliver working software

## Characteristics

- **Short cycles** - Iterations typically last 2-6 weeks
- **Working software** - Each iteration produces a working version of the system
- **Incremental progress** - System functionality grows with each iteration
- **Regular feedback** - [[Stakeholder]]s can see progress and provide input frequently
- **Risk reduction** - Problems are identified and addressed early

## Core Principles

### Iterative Approach
- **Repeat activities** - The same types of work happen in each iteration
- **Refine understanding** - Requirements and design become clearer over time
- **Continuous improvement** - Learn from each iteration to improve the next
- **Adaptive planning** - Plans are adjusted based on what is learned

### Incremental Delivery
- **Build functionality gradually** - Add new features in each iteration
- **Deliver value early** - Users get working software sooner
- **Reduce integration risk** - System components are integrated continuously
- **Enable early validation** - Users can test and validate functionality early

## Benefits of Iterative Development

### Risk Management
- **Early problem detection** - Issues are found when they're easier to fix
- **Technical risk reduction** - Architecture and technology are validated early
- **Requirements risk reduction** - Misunderstandings are caught quickly
- **Integration risk reduction** - Components are integrated regularly

### Stakeholder Benefits
- **Visible progress** - [[Stakeholder]]s see working software regularly
- **Early feedback opportunities** - Input can be provided before it's too late to change
- **Reduced uncertainty** - Progress is measurable and demonstrable
- **Improved communication** - Regular demonstrations facilitate discussion

### Development Benefits
- **Manageable complexity** - Work is broken into smaller, focused chunks
- **Team learning** - Knowledge builds incrementally across iterations
- **Quality improvement** - Testing and quality assurance happen throughout
- **Motivation** - Regular completion of iterations provides sense of progress

## Iteration Structure

### Typical Iteration Activities
1. **Planning** - Define goals and select work for the iteration
2. **Analysis** - Understand requirements for selected functionality
3. **Design** - Create or refine design for the iteration's scope
4. **Implementation** - Code the functionality planned for the iteration
5. **Testing** - Verify that the iteration's deliverables work correctly
6. **Review** - Evaluate results and plan improvements for next iteration

### Iteration Outcomes
- **Working software** - Executable version with new functionality
- **Updated documentation** - Requirements, design, and user documentation
- **Lessons learned** - Understanding of what worked well and what didn't
- **Plan for next iteration** - Based on progress and [[Stakeholder]] feedback

## Relationship to [[Unified Process (UP)]]

### UP Phases and Iterations
- **[[Inception]]** - Usually 1 iteration to establish project feasibility
- **[[Elaboration]]** - Typically 2-3 iterations to establish architecture
- **[[Construction]]** - Multiple iterations to build system functionality  
- **[[Transition]]** - 1-2 iterations to deploy and stabilize the system

### Iterative and Incremental
- **Iterative** - Repeating the same types of activities in cycles
- **Incremental** - Building functionality piece by piece
- **Combined approach** - UP uses both principles together

## Planning Iterations

### Iteration Length
- **Fixed timeboxes** - Consistent iteration length provides rhythm
- **2-6 weeks typical** - Long enough for meaningful work, short enough for feedback
- **Project factors** - Team size, complexity, and risk influence optimal length
- **Consistency important** - Same length helps team establish productive patterns

### Iteration Content
- **Risk-driven selection** - Address highest risks first
- **Value-driven selection** - Deliver highest value features early
- **Dependency-driven selection** - Build foundation functionality first
- **Learning-driven selection** - Tackle uncertain areas early to gain knowledge

### Success Criteria
- **Working software** - Iteration produces demonstrable functionality
- **Quality standards** - Code meets established quality criteria
- **Stakeholder satisfaction** - Delivered functionality meets expectations
- **Schedule adherence** - Iteration completes within planned timeframe

## Common Challenges

### Planning Difficulties
- **Estimating iteration capacity** - Teams need experience to plan accurately
- **Balancing scope and schedule** - Fitting work into fixed timeboxes
- **Managing dependencies** - Coordinating work that spans iterations
- **Handling changing priorities** - Adapting plans while maintaining progress

### Technical Challenges
- **Integration complexity** - Merging work from multiple developers regularly
- **Quality maintenance** - Ensuring quality doesn't degrade with rapid development
- **Architecture evolution** - Adapting design as understanding improves
- **Technical debt management** - Balancing speed with long-term maintainability

### Stakeholder Management
- **Expectation management** - Helping [[Stakeholder]]s understand iterative delivery
- **Feedback quality** - Getting useful input from [[Stakeholder]] reviews
- **Change management** - Handling requests for changes during development
- **Communication overhead** - Regular demonstrations and reviews take time

## Best Practices

### Team Practices
- **Daily coordination** - Brief daily meetings to synchronize work
- **Continuous integration** - Merge and test code changes frequently
- **Automated testing** - Regression tests run automatically
- **Regular retrospectives** - Team reflects on process improvements

### Stakeholder Engagement
- **Regular demonstrations** - Show working software at end of each iteration
- **Active participation** - Encourage [[Stakeholder]] involvement in reviews
- **Clear communication** - Explain progress, issues, and next steps clearly
- **Feedback incorporation** - Show how [[Stakeholder]] input influences development

### Technical Practices
- **Version control** - Track all changes to code and documentation
- **Coding standards** - Consistent quality across team and iterations
- **Refactoring** - Continuously improve code structure and design
- **Documentation** - Keep essential documentation current

## Measurements and Tracking

### Progress Indicators
- **Velocity** - Amount of work completed per iteration
- **Burndown charts** - Visual representation of remaining work
- **Quality metrics** - Defect rates, test coverage, code quality measures
- **[[Stakeholder]] satisfaction** - Feedback ratings and acceptance levels

### Adaptation Signals
- **Velocity trends** - Changes in team productivity over time
- **Quality trends** - Increasing or decreasing defect rates
- **Stakeholder feedback** - Satisfaction levels and change requests
- **Technical indicators** - Architecture stability, integration difficulty

Iterative development is fundamental to modern software development approaches and is essential for managing complexity, risk, and stakeholder expectations in software projects.
