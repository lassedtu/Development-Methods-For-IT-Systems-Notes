Elaboration is the second phase of the [[Unified Process (UP)]], typically following [[Inception]]

It usually lasts several weeks and focuses on refining the project's vision, architecture, and requirements to reduce risks and prepare for detailed design and implementation

Each iteration during this phase typically takes between 2 and 6 weeks

## Key Goals

- Develop a deeper understanding of the system requirements and architecture
- Address major technical risks and uncertainties  
- Establish a stable foundation for design and development
- Expand and clarify functional and non-functional requirements

## Typical Activities

- Elaborate and prioritise detailed requirements (covering about 60â€“80% of [[Functional Requirements]])
- Create and validate architectural prototypes or models
- Refine use cases and domain models
- Identify and mitigate technical risks
- Plan iterations and releases based on refined scope and risks

## Outcomes

- A well-defined and stable architecture baseline
- Detailed and validated requirements ready for design
- Reduced project risks through early technical validation
- Clear iteration plans aligned with project goals

## Artifacts of the Elaboration Phase

Artifacts created during elaboration provide detailed guidance for the development team and [[Stakeholder]]s

They help ensure everyone understands the system's structure and requirements before full-scale development begins

### Examples of Artifacts
- [[Detailed Requirements]]
- [[Architecture Model]]
- [[Use-case Model]]
- [[Domain Model]]
- [[Risk Mitigation Plan]]
- [[Iteration Plan]]
- [[Prototypes or Proofs of Concept]]

You should focus on elaborating the most critical and risky parts of the system during this phase to ensure a solid foundation for subsequent development

The elaboration phase is crucial for establishing the [[Executable Architecture Baseline]] that serves as the foundation for the [[Construction]] phase
