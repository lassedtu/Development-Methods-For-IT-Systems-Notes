Risk identification is the first and foundational step in the risk management process. It involves systematically recognising and documenting potential risks that could affect the success of a project, operation, or objective. The goal of risk identification is to create a comprehensive list of risks that might arise, enabling proactive planning and management.

Key aspects of risk identification include:

- **Sources of Risks:** Identifying where risks may originate, such as technical challenges, resource constraints, external factors, regulatory changes, or stakeholder issues.

- **Techniques Used:** Common methods for risk identification include brainstorming sessions, expert interviews, checklists, SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats), historical data review, and risk workshops.

- **Documentation:** Clearly describing each identified risk with details such as its nature, cause, potential triggers, and possible consequences.

- **Involvement:** Engaging a diverse group of stakeholders, including project team members, subject matter experts, and external partners, to ensure a broad perspective on potential risks.

Effective risk identification lays the groundwork for subsequent steps like risk analysis, planning, and mitigation. Without thorough identification, critical risks may be overlooked, increasing the likelihood of unexpected issues during project execution.

## Example 

In a software development project, the risk identification process might uncover the following potential risks:

- **Technical Risk:** The new technology chosen for the project is unproven and may cause integration issues.
- **Resource Risk:** Key developers may become unavailable due to illness or turnover.
- **Schedule Risk:** Dependencies on third-party vendors could delay critical components.
- **Regulatory Risk:** Upcoming changes in data privacy laws might require significant redesign.
- **Stakeholder Risk:** Misalignment between client expectations and project deliverables could lead to dissatisfaction.

These risks are identified through a combination of brainstorming sessions with the project team, interviews with subject matter experts, and review of lessons learned from previous projects. Each risk is documented with a description, possible causes, and early warning signs to watch for.
