Risk planning involves developing approaches to deal with [[Risk|risks]] before they occur. It is a proactive process aimed at identifying potential risks, assessing their impact, and defining strategies to manage or reduce their effects on a project or objective.

A **[[Risk Mitigation Plan]]** is a key component of risk planning. It is a documented strategy that outlines specific actions and measures to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of identified risks. The goal of a risk mitigation plan is to minimise negative consequences and ensure that risks do not derail the overall success of the project or operation.

Risk planning categories include:

- **Avoidance strategies**  
  Ways to avoid risks altogether by changing plans, processes, or requirements to eliminate the risk source. For example, choosing a different technology or vendor to avoid known issues.

- **Minimisation strategies**  
  Ways to reduce the possible damage or likelihood of risks. This can include implementing safeguards, improving quality controls, or increasing monitoring to detect early warning signs.

- **Contingency plans**  
  Preparing for the worst-case scenarios with backup plans if risks materialise. These plans define specific steps to take if a risk event occurs, ensuring a quick and effective response to limit damage.

By carefully planning for risks and having mitigation strategies in place, organizations can improve their resilience and increase the chances of project success.
