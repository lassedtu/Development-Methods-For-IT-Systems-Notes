Vision defines who the product benefits what problem it solves and the ultimate goal or purpose of the project

Vision in the [[inception]] phase means defining and agreeing on the big picture purpose and intended impact of the product before detailed planning or development

A vision statement is a short description explaining what the project aims to achieve and why it exists

It describes the main goal of the product who it is for and what problem it will solve

The vision statement helps everyone understand the big picture purpose and direction of the project before any further work begins

## Examples of vision statements

- A platform that connects local farmers directly to consumers to provide fresh affordable produce and support sustainable agriculture

- An app that helps busy professionals manage their time better by providing simple effective scheduling tools

- A service that enables students to access quality online tutoring anytime anywhere to improve learning outcomes

## Why vision matters

- Aligns the team around a common goal and purpose

- Guides decision making and prioritisation during the project

- Communicates the value and impact of the product to [[stakeholder]]s

- Provides motivation and clarity throughout development

## How to create a vision statement

- Identify the target users or customers

- Define the key problem or need the product addresses

- Describe the ultimate benefit or change the product will deliver

- Keep it clear concise and inspiring
