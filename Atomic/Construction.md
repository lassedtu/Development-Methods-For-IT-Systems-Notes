Construction is the third and longest phase of the [[Unified Process (UP)]], following [[Elaboration]]

This phase focuses on building the system through iterative development where most of the actual programming and implementation happens

Construction continues until the system is ready for deployment to end users

## Key Goals

- Develop the complete system functionality iteratively
- Minimize development costs through efficient resource management
- Achieve adequate quality through rigorous testing
- Complete all remaining features and requirements
- Prepare for system deployment and user training

## Typical Activities

- Implement the remaining functional requirements (the remaining 20â€“40% after [[Elaboration]])
- Continue iterative development with regular builds and testing
- Perform extensive testing including unit, integration, and system testing
- Refine the system architecture as needed while maintaining the baseline
- Create user documentation and training materials
- Prepare deployment and installation procedures

## Characteristics

- **Longest phase** in terms of time and resources
- **Most programming activity** occurs during this phase
- **Risk levels** are generally lower than in earlier phases since major risks were addressed in [[Elaboration]]
- **Team size** may be at its largest during this phase
- **Focus shifts** from analysis and design to implementation and testing

## Outcomes

- A complete software system ready for deployment
- Comprehensive test results demonstrating system quality
- User documentation and training materials
- Deployment procedures and installation guides
- System ready for the [[Transition]] phase

## Relationship to Other Phases

Construction builds upon the foundation established during [[Elaboration]], using the stable architecture baseline and detailed requirements

The phase continues the iterative approach of the [[Unified Process (UP)]], with each iteration delivering working software

Success in construction depends heavily on the quality of work done in [[Inception]] and [[Elaboration]] phases
