The inception phase is the initial stage of a project typically lasting 1–2 weeks. The main purpose of the inception phase is to determine whether the project should proceed or be abandoned. During this phase the team works to establish a common vision and define the scope of the product.

## Key Goals

- Decide if the project is viable and worth pursuing.
- Align stakeholders on the vision and scope.
- Identify major risks and constraints early.

## Typical Activities

- Gather and document initial requirements (about 10–20% of [[functional requirements]]).
- Identify stakeholders and their needs.
- Define the main goals and purpose of the project.
- Create essential artifacts (such as [[Vision Statement]], [[Business Case]], [[Stakeholder List]], [[risk assessment]]).

## Outcomes

- A shared understanding of what the project is about.
- Agreement on what needs to be done and who is involved.
- A decision on whether to move forward with the project.
