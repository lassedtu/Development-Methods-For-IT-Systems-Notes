The inception phase is the initial stage of a project typically lasting 1–2 weeks. The main purpose of the inception phase is to determine whether the project should proceed or be abandoned. During this phase the team works to establish a common vision and define the [[scope]] of the product.

## Key Goals

- Decide if the project is viable and worth pursuing.
- Align stakeholders on the vision and scope.
- Identify major risks and constraints early.

## Typical Activities

- Gather and document initial requirements (about 10–20% of [[functional requirements]]).
- Identify stakeholders and their needs.
- Define the main goals and purpose of the project.
- Create essential artifacts (such as [[Vision]], [[Business Case]], [[Stakeholder List]], [[Risk Assessment]]).

## Outcomes

- A shared understanding of what the project is about.
- Agreement on what needs to be done and who is involved.
- A decision on whether to move forward with the project.

## Artifacts of the Inception phase

Artifacts are the important documents and notes created during the inception phase. They show what the project is about, who is involved, and what needs to be done. These help everyone understand and agree on the project before it really starts.

### Examples of Artifacts
- [[Vision]]
- [[Business Case]]
- [[Stakeholder List]]
- [[Initial requirements]]
- [[Risk assessment]]
- [[Project plan]]
- [[Use-case model]]
- [[Domain model]]
- [[Glossary]]
- [[Iteration Plan]]

You don’t have to create every artifact listed. You should choose the ones that make sense for your project. For the inception phase, you only need to write about 10-20% of the functional requirements, just enough to get started and show the main ideas.
