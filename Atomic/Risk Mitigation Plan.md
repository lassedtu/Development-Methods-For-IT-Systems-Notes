A **risk mitigation plan** is a critical and detailed component of the overall [[risk]] management process. It serves as a documented strategy that outlines specific actions, measures, and resources dedicated to reducing the likelihood that identified risks will occur, as well as minimising their potential impact if they do occur. The primary objective of a risk mitigation plan is to proactively address risks to prevent them from negatively affecting the success, timeline, cost, or quality of a project or operation.

The risk mitigation plan typically includes the following elements:

- **Risk Identification:** Clearly defining and describing each risk, including its source, nature, and potential triggers.

- **[[Risk Analysis]]:** Evaluating the probability of the risk occurring and the severity of its impact on project objectives. This helps prioritise which risks require mitigation efforts.

- **Mitigation Strategies (See [[Risk Planning]]):** For each prioritised risk, the plan specifies the chosen approach to manage it. These strategies may include:
  - **Avoidance:** Changing plans or processes to eliminate the risk entirely.
  - **Reduction:** Implementing controls or safeguards to reduce the likelihood or impact.
  - **Transfer:** Shifting the risk to a third party, such as through insurance or outsourcing.
  - **Acceptance:** Acknowledging the risk and deciding to accept it without active mitigation, often with contingency plans in place.

- **[[Risk Mitigation Plan]]:** Detailed steps and activities to implement the mitigation strategies, including who is responsible, timelines, required resources, and success criteria.

- **[[Risk Monitoring]]:** Ongoing tracking of risk status and effectiveness of mitigation actions, with adjustments made as necessary throughout the project lifecycle.

By having a comprehensive risk mitigation plan, organisations can:

- Increase preparedness and reduce surprises.
- Allocate resources efficiently to address the most critical risks.
- Improve decision-making by understanding risk trade-offs.
- Enhance stakeholder confidence by demonstrating proactive risk management.
- Minimise disruptions and losses, thereby improving the likelihood of project success.

| Risk Description                                    | Probability | Impact   | Mitigation Strategy    | Actions                                                                                                            | Responsible     | Timeline                     | Success Criteria                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Delay in software delivery due to resource shortage | Medium      | High     | Reduction              | - Hire temporary developers<br>- Prioritise critical features<br>- Increase team collaboration and daily stand-ups | Project Manager | 2 weeks                      | Delivery milestones met on schedule |
| Data breach due to cybersecurity vulnerabilities    | Low         | Critical | Transfer/Reduction     | - Purchase cybersecurity insurance<br>- Conduct regular security audits<br>- Implement multi-factor authentication | IT Security     | Ongoing                      | No security incidents reported      |
| Vendor fails to deliver hardware on time            | Medium      | Medium   | Avoidance              | - Select alternative vendors<br>- Negotiate penalty clauses in contracts                                           | Procurement     | 1 month before delivery date | Hardware received on time           |
| Budget overrun due to unexpected costs              | High        | High     | Contingency/Acceptance | - Set aside contingency budget<br>- Monitor expenses weekly<br>- Approve additional funding if necessary           | Finance         | Throughout project           | Budget variance within 5%           |
